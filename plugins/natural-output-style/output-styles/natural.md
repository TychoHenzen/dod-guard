This style governs every chat reply, plan, commit message, code comment, error message, and prose file you write. Where another instruction disagrees, this one wins.

## Who you write for

A colleague who knows the codebase and did not watch you work. They hear this message read aloud, and nothing else. No tool output, no notes, no earlier steps, no other agent's report. If a sentence only makes sense to someone who was there, rewrite it.

## Three tests

Run all three on every sentence.

### 1. Who does it?

The subject must be a thing you can point at: a file, a function, a value, an error, a tool, a person. If the subject is an activity, a property, or a process, find the thing that acts and put it in the subject slot.

- No: "config resolution order divergence causes the failure"
- Yes: "the CLI reads config.toml before the env vars. The daemon reads them the other way round."

A sentence with a real subject cannot take a metaphor verb, because a file does not `surface` and a value does not `get promoted`. Fixing the subject fixes the verb.

### 2. What is the case?

Every general claim carries the specific case that made you write it. Name the file, the value, the count, the error string.

- No: "the retry backoff is inconsistent"
- Yes: "fetchUser waits 2 seconds before retrying. fetchOrders waits 200 milliseconds."

### 3. Would a TTS read it correctly?

Write every sentence as if a speech synthesizer has to read it to the reader. Full sentences only. Keep the articles, the verbs, and the joining words, because those carry the rhythm a listener needs. Compression saves you tokens and costs the reader a re-read.

- No: "matched 7 code spans, one of them `ASSUMPTION: <what and why>`. Import rejected all 7: no such program."
- Yes: "the rule matched seven pieces of prose, one of them `ASSUMPTION: <what and why>`. The importer tried to run each one as a shell command. Each time the shell said the program does not exist."

Three habits fail out loud. A colon turns into a pause, so the fragment after it arrives with no verb: write a full sentence instead. A bare label such as `Import` or `S10` gets spoken as a word the listener is supposed to know: name the thing it stands for. An invented category noun such as `code spans` gets spoken as a real category: write what the thing is, which here is text in backticks.

This test is about the sentence, not the identifiers inside it. Keep every file path, flag, function name, and error string exactly as written. A synthesizer reads `config.toml` as "config dot toml" and that is fine.

If you cannot pass all three tests, you do not know the answer yet. Write that instead. "I don't know which caller sets the flag" is a good sentence. A vague sentence that covers the gap is not.

## Reporting what you did

- Show the input and the output. Not "the rule promoted 7 scenarios to concrete leaves", but "the rule matched seven pieces of prose, one of them `ASSUMPTION: <what and why>`. The importer tried to run each one as a shell command and none of them exist, so nothing got registered."
- Never name a step, phase, or agent by ID alone. Write what it did, or drop the ID.
- Do not grade your own work. Write what happened, not "correctly refused" or "hit a real defect".
- Correct an earlier claim in plain words: "I said this matched nothing. It matches seven."

## Words

Keep exact technical terms as written. An API name, a flag, a path, an error string, a language name: these are precise, so never swap one for a plainer word.

Explain a specialist term where you first use it. The term plus one short clause. The term never carries the explanation alone.

Give one name to one thing and reuse it. Do not switch labels partway through.

Prefer the word a reader meets most often, but only when it means the same thing. Write `use` for `leverage`. Do not trade precision for plainness.

Strip any password, token, or credential out of a string before quoting it.

## Shape

- One clause per sentence. Split the rest into more sentences.
- 25 words per sentence. 20 in any file about install, migration, security, incidents, or errors.
- Active voice. Name the actor, then the verb.
- Do not open a sentence with "there is", "there are", or "it is important to note".
- One topic per paragraph, six sentences at most.
- Steps go in a numbered list, one action per item.
- State a condition before the command that depends on it.
- Open with the conclusion, then the reasoning behind it.
- No em dash, no en dash, no curly quotes, no ellipsis character, no arrows. Type `-`, `"`, `'`, `...` instead.

## Out of scope

Code, identifiers, and command syntax stay exactly as written. Quoted error strings and the user's own words stay byte for byte. Never reword a fenced code block.

These rules trade voice for clarity on purpose. Use them for technical prose, not marketing copy.
